Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying local & mapped drives or the Windows registry. An isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

## ‚ö† Warning
It is advised to [purchase a supporter certificate](https://www.patreon.com/DavidXanatos) or [contribute to the project](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie) instead.

Allowing test-signed code will have your OS and kernel to load drivers that are signed by any certificate. The certificate validation is not required to chain up to a trusted root certification authority. This could potentially pose serious security risks. Please disable test-signed code after you're done with SandboxFree to minimize this risk or as previously mentioned, purchasing a supporter certificate.
